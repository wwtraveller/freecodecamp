/*Step 14*/
/*       You have styled three elements by writing CSS inside the style tags. This works, but since there will be many more styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it.*/

/*We have created a separate styles.css file for you and switched the editor view to that file. You can change between files with the tabs at the top of the editor.*/

/*Start by rewriting the styles you have created into the styles.css file. Make sure to exclude the opening and closing style tags.*/

h1, h2, p {
    text-align: center;
}

/*Step 18*/
/*       The text is centered again so the link to the CSS file is working. Add another style to the file that changes the background-color property to brown for the body element.*/

/*body {*/
/*    background-color: brown;*/
/*}*/

/*Step 19*/
/*       That brown background makes it hard to read the text. Change the body element's background color to be burlywood so it has some color but you are still be able to read the text.*/

/*body {*/
/*    background-color: burlywood;*/
/*}*/

/*Step 21*/
/*The goal now is to make the div not take up the entire width of the page. The CSS width property is perfect for this.*/

/*You can use the id selector to target a specific element with an id attribute. An id selector is defined by placing the hash symbol # directly in front of the element's id value. For example, if an element has the id of cat then you would target that element like this:*/

/*#cat {*/
/*    width: 250px;*/
/*}*/
/*Use the #menu selector to give your element a width of 300px.*/

/*#menu {*/
/*    width: 300px;*/
/*}*/

/*Step 22*/
/*Comments in CSS look like this:*/

/*    !* comment here *!*/
/*In your style sheet, comment out the line containing the background-color property and value, so you can see the effect of only styling the #menu element. This will make the background white again.*/

body {
    /*
    background-color: burlywood;
    */
}

/*Step 23*/
/*Now use the existing #menu selector to set the background color of the div element to be burlywood.*/

/*#menu {*/
/*    width: 300px;*/
/*    background-color: burlywood;*/
/*}*/

/*Step 24*/
/*Now it's easy to see that the text is centered inside the #menu element. Currently, the width of the #menu element is specified in pixels (px).*/

/*Change the width property's value to be 80%, to make it 80% the width of its parent element (body).*/

#menu {
    width: 80%;
    background-color: burlywood;
}

/*Step 25*/
/*Next, you want to center the #menu horizontally. You can do this by setting its margin-left and margin-right properties to auto. Think of the margin as invisible space around an element. Using these two margin properties, center the #menu element within the body element.*/

#menu {
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}
