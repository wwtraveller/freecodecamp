/*Step 14*/
/*       You have styled three elements by writing CSS inside the style tags. This works, but since there will be many more styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it.*/

/*We have created a separate styles.css file for you and switched the editor view to that file. You can change between files with the tabs at the top of the editor.*/

/*Start by rewriting the styles you have created into the styles.css file. Make sure to exclude the opening and closing style tags.*/

h1, h2, p {
    text-align: center;
}

/*Step 18*/
/*       The text is centered again so the link to the CSS file is working. Add another style to the file that changes the background-color property to brown for the body element.*/

body {
    background-color: brown;
}
