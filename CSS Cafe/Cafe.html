<!--Step 20-->
<!--The div element is used mainly for design layout purposes unlike the other content elements you have used so far. Add a div element inside the body element and then move all the other elements inside the new div.-->

<!--Inside the opening div tag, add the id attribute with a value of menu.-->

            <h2>Coffee</h2>
<!--            Step 29-->
<!--            Itâ€™s looking good. Time to start adding some menu items. Add an empty article element under the Coffee heading. It will contain a flavor and price of each coffee you currently offer.-->
<!--            -->
<!--            Step 36-->
<!--            That is kind of what you want, but now it would be nice if the flavor and price were on the same line. p elements are block-level elements, so they take up the entire width of their parent element.-->

<!--            To get them on the same line, you need to apply some styling to the p elements so they behave more like inline elements. To do that, start by adding a class attribute with the value item to the first article element under the Coffee heading.-->
<!--            -->
            <article class="item">
<!--                Step 30-->
<!--                article elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information. In this case, it will contain a coffee flavor and a price for that flavor. Nest two p elements inside your article element. The first one's text should be French Vanilla, and the second's text 3.00.-->
<!--                -->
<!--                Step 32-->
<!--                The flavors and prices are currently stacked on top of each other and centered with their respective p elements. It would be nice if the flavor was on the left and the price was on the right.-->

<!--                Add the class name flavor to the French Vanilla p element.-->
<!--                -->

<!--                Step 34-->
<!--                Next, you want to align the price to the right. Add a class named price to your p element that has 3.00 as its text.-->

<!--                Step 40-->
<!--                That worked, but there is still a little space on the right of the price.-->

<!--                You could keep trying various percentages for the widths. Instead, use the back space key on your keyboard to move the p element with the class price next to the p element with the class flavor so that they are on the same line in the editor. Make sure there is no space between them.-->
<!--                -->
                <p class="flavor">French Vanilla</p><p class="price">3.00</p>
            </article>
<!--                Step 31-->
<!--                Starting below the existing coffee/price pair, add the following coffee and prices using article elements with two nested p elements inside each. As before, the first p element's text should contain the coffee flavor and the second p element's text should contain the price.-->
